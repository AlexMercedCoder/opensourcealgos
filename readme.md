# Basic Algorithms and Coding Challenges

The purpose of this repo is to list a lot of basic algorithmic and coding challenges. While I will present these algorithms as Javascript, this can be done in any programming language, just create a function that meets the specifications of the algorithm.

I will provide solutions for these algorithms, keep in mind these aren't the only possible solution or even always the best solution. Hopefully these algorithms give some basic exercises to help improve your programmatic thinking.
